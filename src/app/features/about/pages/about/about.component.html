    <h3>Who am I</h3>
    <p>
      I'm Lily Vandenbore and I'm a {{ age }} year old passionate full stack developer who has been
      programming since the age of 11. My primary focus is back end, but I also enjoy doing front end development.<br><br>

      I believe that my passion and deeply ingrained interest in the world of software development is what makes me valuable.
      It motivates me to learn technologies regardless of whether I have to or not. <br><br>

      The majority of the developers I've met don't have a big interest in what they're doing. Some are in it for the money,
      others because they believe there's a lot of job opportunities in the field.
      People in the field of software development with a true passion is rare. But this passion is exactly what makes a programmer valuable,
      because it's this same passion, that drives developers to grow and to continue learning as each day passes.

    <h3>My history</h3>
    <p>
      When I first started my exciting programming journey, I learned to write code in both C and Python.
      My first projects were nothing special, as I was brand new to the world of programming.
      But I quickly discovered how much I truly love both programming and learning new technologies.<br><br>

      Throughout the years, I've learned many new programming languages, technologies and ways to think about programming.<br><br>
      During my journey, I also picked up some other relevant skills that I deem important.
      Some of these include Linux systems, some basic ethical hacking, scripting and networking.<br><br>

      When I was a young teen, I also went to CodeFever to follow some programming classes designed for younger people.
      Although I was a bit ahead compared to my classmates due to how much time I spent programming, it was really nice
      to be surrounded with other programmers, and to help my classmates when possible.<br><br>

      Once I turned 18, I started my Associate of Computer Programming.
      During this time, I learned some valuable technologies and made many friends with whom I worked together, which in turn helped me
      grow as a developer and a team player.<br><br>

      I also did an internship at FOD Economy as a full stack developer during my final year of the degree.
      Here we used Spring Boot and Angular to develop the project. This was my first taste of what it's like
      to work as a full stack developer on a real job, and I loved it.

    <h3>
      Where I'm currently at
    </h3>
    <p>
      I am currently studying at VIVES Kortrijk to get a Bachelor of Applied Computer Science and
      will graduate in 2024.<br><br>

      I've always loved to help friends and people I meet online to both program and to help those who can program,
      become even better. This combined with my past at CodeFever is why I'm currently working a student job at CodeFever as a teaching assistant.
