    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello, I'm Lily Vandenbore and I'm a passionate software developer who has been
      programming since the age of 11.<br>
      I've always been eager to try and learn technologies to become a better developer.<br><br>

      I am currently studying at VIVES Kortrijk to get a bachelor degree in Applied Computer Science and
      will graduate in 2024.<br><br>

      My passion for software development and geeky computer things also makes me love helping friends
      and people I meet online to both program, and to help those who can program become even better.
      This is why I'm currently working a student job at CodeFever as a teaching assistant.
