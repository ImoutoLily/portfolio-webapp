    <h3>Who am I</h3>
    <p>
      I'm Lily Vandenbore and I'm a {{ age }} year old passionate full stack developer who has been
      programming since the age of 11. My primary focus is back end, but I also enjoy doing front end development.<br><br>

      I believe that my passion and deeply ingrained interest in the world of software development is what makes me valuable.
      It motivates me to learn technologies regardless of whether I have to or not. <br><br>

      The majority of the developers I've met don't have a big interest in what they're doing. Some are in it for the money,
      others because they believe there are a lot of job opportunities in the field.
      People in the field of software development with a true passion are rare. But this passion is exactly what makes a programmer valuable,
      because it's this same passion, that drives developers to grow and to continue learning as each day passes.

    <h3>My history</h3>
    <p>
      When I first started my exciting programming journey, I learned to write code in both C and Python.
      My first projects were nothing special, as I was brand new to the world of programming.
      But I quickly discovered how much I truly love both programming and learning new technologies.<br><br>

      Throughout the years, I've learned many new programming languages, technologies and ways to think about programming.<br><br>
      During my journey, I also picked up some other relevant skills that I deemed important.
      Some of these include Linux systems, some basic ethical hacking, scripting and networking.<br><br>

      Once I turned 18, I started my Associate of Computer Programming.
      During this time, I learned some valuable technologies and made many friends with whom I worked together, which in turn helped me
      grow as a developer and a team player.<br><br>

      I also did an internship at FOD Economy as a full stack developer during my final year of my Associate of Computer Programming.
      Here we used Spring Boot and Angular to develop the project. This was my first taste of what it's like
      to work as a full stack developer on a real job, and I loved it.<br><br>

      After completing my Associate degree in Computer Programming, I continued my studies with a Bachelor of Applied Computer Science,
      which provided me the opportunity to learn more technologies and sharpen my skills.<br><br>

      At the conclusion of my Bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Science, I was required to complete another internship, which I did at
      the company Delaware. There, I was tasked with a project that involved converting the old admin portal settings, previously managed
      through JSON, to an elegant and user-friendly set of interfaces for each individual settings component. These interfaces were
      generated from metadata tied to the corresponding models. This project was implemented through the use of ASP.NET and React,
      featuring a custom solution dynamically generating both metadata and settings pages.<br><br>

      During the final year of my Bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Science, I also worked at CodeFever as a teaching assistant.
      My passion for programming has always driven me to enjoy teaching and helping others in the field. This passion, combined with
      my past at CodeFever, motivated me to pursue a student job there.<br><br>
